This is a challenge project to make a twitter/X clone.

I will be using what I know about html, databases and flask to make this project.
I will also be experimenting with some basic css such as bootstrap.

## How to use

- Run pipenv install to install dependencies
- Run pipenv shell to enter the virtual environment
- Run python3 app.py to start the web server
- Run pytest to run any project tests
