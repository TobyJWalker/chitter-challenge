This is a challenge project to make a twitter/X clone.

I will be using what I know about html, databases and flask to make this project.
I will also be experimenting with some basic css such as bootstrap.

## How to use

- Run pipenv install to install dependencies

- Install psql
- Create 'chitter' database
- run 'python3 lib/model_definition.py' to create the tables
- Optionally run 'python3 seeds/seed_db.py' to seed the database with test data

- Create a .env file with an email and password for the email account you want to use to send emails from. Keys are EMAIL_ADDR and GMAIL_APP_PW. Email functionality is disabled without these.

The last one is the password for the email account. This is needed because gmail requires an app password to be used for sending emails from a python script. This is a security feature. You can find out more about it here: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en

I can provide you with an email and password if you want to test the email functionality. Just ask me.

- Run pipenv shell to enter the virtual environment and load variables
- Run 'python3 app.py' to start the web server
- Run pytest to run any project tests

## Testing

Pytest is used to test this project.
The database is seeded using the seeds/seed_db.py file
This file uses peewee to seed the database with test data.

Make sure that the database and tables have been created before running tests.

## Technologies used
